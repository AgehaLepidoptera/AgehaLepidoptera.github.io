     <p>What else should I write?<p>
     <p><i>I'm not sure... how about music tastes?<i><p>
     <p>No way, nobody wants to hear the preferences of some random person online. That's just weird.<p>
     <p><i>How about your favorite animal then?<i><p>
     <p>Degu.<p>
     <p><i>A what?<i><p>
     <p>The small Chilean rodent!<p>
     <p><i>I'm starting to regret giving you that question.<i><p>
     <p>But they are so cute!<p>
     <p><i>Alright, you should most likely put something else here incase someone reads it.<i><p>
     <p>But I can't think of anything else.<p>
     <p><i>Why don't you count numbers while you think?<i><p>
     <p>I hate numbers, they always pile up and add to each other until you're left with a huge incomprehensible number. Or they subtract into the void like nothing ever happened, It's sickening to just ponder that.<p> 
     <p><i>Why don't you write something else?<i><p>
     <p>Good idea!<p>
     <p><i>Well?<i><p>
     <p>I can't think of anything else.<p>
